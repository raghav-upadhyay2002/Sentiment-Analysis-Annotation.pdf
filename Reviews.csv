"So far everything works very smoothly, battery is fine, no serious chips just a tiny tiny dent on the back. Only thing is the screen was obviously what was replaced because it’s very warped, but it doesn’t effect the actual display or touch so unless that would bother you it’s a non issue. another thing, if you get the 15 DO NOT do the data transfer on set up then update, the update will not install. either set it up without or do icloud, then do the update from the settings, then do your data transfer, i promise it will actually save you time in the long run",Positive,Positive

"I’m always a bit leery of ordering used phones, however, this one works great. No issues. As described.I realize this review is not really about the phone, but rather the seller. I was pleasantly surprised by not having any issues.",Positive,Positive

"Phone came nicely and neatly packed, I opened the case to find my phone in perfect condition, 100% battery capacity, and pretty decently charged. I have also had an incident with support which they ended up resolving in that same day and they were really friendly and helpful. Phone was also still within apple care warranty!",Positive,Positive
Mine came in flawless and the battery health is 100%. I have been buying phones through Amazon Renewed for the past 3 phones now and not one complaint. Much cheaper than buying a brand new one while still boasting almost the same condition. Highly recommend!,Positive,Positive

Received in nice packaging with a charging cable. Works perfectly.,Positive,Positive

"I never review however am highly impressed with this product. I recently broke my iPhone 15 and refused to buy the same phone for the same price at apple. After researching renewed options from different sites this option came up as the best priced for the best quality. I’ve bought renewed items before from others sellers / companies and have had issues, so I was a little nervous. When the phone arrived I was shocked at the quality. It looked brand new. No scratches or any issues at all. I will never buy a brand new phone again when I can buy it for half the price for the same quality. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SERVICE / PRODUCT",Positive,Positive
ok,Positive,Positive
Since I didn’t get the best refurbished one but its surpassed my expectations. I’d add a picture but I’m currently using the phone to type this review.,Positive,Negative
"If this phone is 'renewed' I would have no Idea what a new one would be like. super, super deal.",Positive,Positive
Bought as a gift and the color is great,Positive,Positive
I ordered this phone back in April/may and I do not regret it one bit! It works great and the color is really pretty the camera quality is good too. The phone had no damages and everything is as it should be,Positive,Positive
This company did a good job with taking care of this device i got a iphone 15 and it works perfectly. the packaging was not the greatest though there wasn’t enough bubble rap.,Positive,Positive
"This IPhone 15 came earlier than I expected and it made me feel better because my iPhone 8 was getting slow. I am really satisfied with this phone and for the price you can’t beat a nice hand me down phone without any scratches. Thank you for the amazing deal on a good phone, I chose this phone for the camera and it is worth it. Now I can take some good pictures of all sorts of things!",Positive,Positive
"Upgraded from my iPhone 11 that was suffering due to poor battery health after many years of use. Was nervous about buying a refurbished iPhone but thought that Amazon is a trusted shopping center that I might give it a try to buy the new iPhone 15 for a discount through this seller. This iPhone 15 is a great upgrade. I watched a few videos online to make sure this phone was authentic and from my observation it is just like new. The phone came with 100% battery health and only 12 cycles on it. Battery works really well. Has a 5G connection and setting up the phone with my cell carrier Verizon was a breeze with e-sim feature. The phone came with a charger as well. The camera takes really great quality photos as well (Picture of the pink rose is the iPhone 15’s camera quality). You should expect to find all iPhone 15 features on this phone, including the Dynamic Island, if you so choose to purchase this refurbished model. The only fault on this phone is that it heats up every time I’m on a video call. However, through research it seems this problem might be the same with all iPhone 15 models through Apple. After my experience shopping for this new phone I would consider buying a refurbished device in the future with Amazon again as well. Such a great deal for a new phone.",Positive,Positive
I ordered the wrong size but overall I love my iPhone 15!!!,Positive,Positive
Great company had an issue but they took care of it fast. I am very grateful,Positive,Positive
10/10 brand new 100% battery life with not a single scratch,Positive,Positive
"It was time for me to upgrade my old iPhone 7 since it was not updating to the latest iOS. I researched and decided I got the best bang for my buck if I went for the iPhone 15 rather than the iPhone 13. The quality of the unlocked refurbished phone is outstanding. It's just like new except for the packaging. I especially appreciate the much longer battery life as my previous phone I had to recharge constantly during the day. On this one the battery lasts all day. I haven't had the opportunity to use the camera often but it seems there are a few nice options on there. The extra black space at the top of the phone shows any extra application you may be using in tandem with what's on the face of the phone. This is really handy, for example, if you're using the Google navigation and go away from that to check your messages.",Positive,Positive
Was hestitant ordering a refurbished phone especially a iPhone 15 & the price I got it for! But it was in perfect condition battery is 98% super impressed & will be ordering again,Positive,Positive
"Arrived promptly, in good shape, and accepted transfer data from prior phone without issues. We’ll see how battery life does over time- so far so good.",Positive,Positive
Value for the money. Highly recommend.,Positive,Positive
Excellent battery life. Almost brand new. I will buy from this seller again.,Positive,Positive
He hasn't complained yet he loves it he's very happy,Positive,Positive
It’s so goood!! It’s literally brand new I love ittt,Positive,Positive
"I ordered this phone because it was cheaper than a renewed one on the Apple site. I did watch a lot of videos about fake iPhone 15. And this one passed all the tests. I was happy to see that the battery is 100% capacity. And it only had eight cycles when I got it. There was a tiny bit of scratching on the screen, but with the screen protector I put on I can’t even tell. I think I will keep getting Amazon renewed phones from now on. My last phone was an iPhone RX so this is a huge upgrade.",Positive,Positive
"Phone and battery are in excellent condition, and everything is working perfectly so far. Will update if something goes wrong.",Positive,Positive
"My hesitation to buy this IPhone from Amazon’s renewed program was unwarranted. The phone arrived in excellent condition. The battery charged to 100%, showed 6 cycles and there were no bumps, bruises or knots that indicated hard use or wear and tear—just a barely noticeable nick on the screen. . Transferring data from my 11Pro to the 15 was fast and easy. The only challenge I experienced was installing the ESim card and my carrier helped with that. So far, I haven’t experienced problems with the applications I use most often. My tablet and watch connected easily and I have twice the capacity of my old phone. After reading about the renew program, I felt much safer than going through other Marketplaces where there is no guarantee for the product you purchase.Winning!",Positive,Positive
For those who are scared of buying from this user this product is really good I’m only 16 and it is amazing hasn’t cause my problems comes with a charger but no block .Mine looks brand new not a single scratch or crack,Positive,Positive
Looks and works like new! No issues.,Positive,Positive
"Bought this iPhone 15 for my son. He’s in college. He’s no longer complaining. His previous phone was a 13 mini. The phone was in excellent condition and had him put on an otter box case before it left the house. I got his 13 mini now. Cleaned the ports, replaced screen and got a new battery. The15 is better for him and he likes it very much.",Positive,Positive
"Came perfect, in a week, battery percentage was at max, which made me surprise, would totally recommend",Positive,Positive
Bought a new phone from my carrier for $830 when the same phone was on here in practically the same condition for almost $200 less! Returned the other one and kept this one and it was the easiest $200 I’ve saved. At first I wasn’t sure about ordering a phone online but seller and Amazon were quick to ease any worries and offered returns easily.,Positive,Positive
"got it pretty quick , no scratches and works great",Positive,Positive
"The iPhone was shipped fast, came in charged and ready to go. iPhone was as stated, unlocked and I was able to connect it to my service in minutes. Overall experience, Very Good.",Positive,Positive
"I recently purchased an iPhone and couldn't be happier with my decision! The price was incredibly affordable, and the quality of the product is top-notch. It works perfectly and looks brand new. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great deal on a high-quality phone!",Positive,Positive
"This is a very good product to invest in, i got mine with only one charge cycle. i’m very happy with my purchase i definitely will order from this store again!",Positive,Positive
Very happy with my refurbished iPhone 15. Have been using it for several weeks and it has not given me any problems.,Positive,Positive
The exterior condition of the phone is perfect. Just like brand new so it lived up to the excellent condition rating. The battery health was 100% with 191 cycles when received. Couldn’t ask for a better used phone ,Positive,Positive
My renewed iphone came with very minimal defects (1 or 2 small one on the sides). Almost to small to notice. The screen was protected by a protector and also a sleeve on top of a plastic bag. The box it came in was secure on all sides and the phone was placed in a plastic holder. Ive used the phone for almost 2 days and have 0 issues or concerns. The phone only took 3 days to ship!,Positive,Positive
"I just bought the iPhone 15 with 256Gb memory for $710. The battery had 2 cycles on it. Manufactured in Dec 2023. First used May 2024. Easy set-up with eSIM (just to type in the IMEI) and super simple transfer of data from my trusted, but aging iPhone 7+. The phone had no scratches - condition as new (excellent). What is not to like 😂 Happy to spend $200 less ",Positive,Positive
"I had only 3 cycles on this phone, and battery health was at 100%, it was also in perfect condition appearance wise.",Positive,Positive
"Phone came really fast. I bought the phone on July 20th, phone was expected to arrive by Wednesday but instead came by today which is Monday. Phone is in excellent condition and everything works perfectly. It doesn’t come with the original box or charger however a charger is provided which charges really fast! I would definitely buy again! Also comes with no scratches whatsoever!",Positive,Positive
arrived in perfect condition with 100% battery capacity. no scratches or dents. 10/10,Positive,Positive
I was a bit hesitant due to the latest reviews but it works really well. I bought a renewed iPhone 15 128gb. Came exactly on time and been using it for 2 weeks. Great seller.,Positive,Positive
"love! had a 13 pro before so i lost a few features since this one isn’t a pro but other then that the battery health was at 100%, and a few very small scratches on screen but you can’t see them at all with a screen protector on it. so far no issues",Positive,Positive
Phone is like new…no signs of use. The only thing is it is not blue like in the pictures…looks white.,Positive,Positive
"The seller I used was WeDeliverWireless. The phone I received has zero scratches or any other blemishes, basically like it looks brand new. The only thing I noticed is that the charger hole seemed a little dirty/stained but honestly not that much at all. (See picture, you can see the white part is a little dirty?) The phone came bubble-wrapped nicely with a charger. I checked the day after activating it, and it says there were 51 charge cycles and the battery health is 100% (may have been 50 before I used it). Amazing and I can’t wait to use it!",Positive,Positive
it was good nothing wrong with it,Positive,Positive
"Excellent condition, like new in appearance. No scratches, 100% battery capacity",Positive,Positive
"I ordered the phone in excellent renewed condition and I am wildly impressed. There were no visible defects that I could find anywhere including the screen. Battery capacity was still at 100% too! With the money I saved buying renewed instead of a new iPhone, I treated myself to some new AirPods and still have some savings to spare. If you’re on the fence about buying renewed, definitely go for it!",Positive,Positive
"Returned waiting for return from Affirm, who has been harassing me, (threatening my credit rating) for payment. Seller was great. Easy to message. Quick to respond. Hoping Affirm follows through, need to contact Amazon CUSTOMER SUPPORT. Hoping to avoid a hassle.",Positive,Positive
"Only 18 cycles. No scratches, no dents. Absolutely perfect. This phone is basically brand new but only paid $670 for a $900-$1000 phone (at time of purchase). Girlfriend loved it. Doesn’t come in Apple box, but that doesn’t matter, we throw them away anyways. I was worried as I never bought a phone online before, but this was perfect.",Positive,Positive
Such a great price & such great quality. I’m so glad for purchasing here instead of the Apple store. Saved a bit of money that way. Definitely recommend!,Positive,Positive
"Only issue was a random glitch on the screen when we first got it but then randomly stopped. Great phone, nice camera, screen, and most up to date at the moment.",Positive,Negative
"Came in perfect condition everything works fine no issues at all. Didn't arrive in an apple box, but that's no big deal.",Positive,Positive
"It says 99% battery life, but the phone doesn’t act like new. The percentage drops quickly, and it gets a little warm while using it. Overall, it is a good phone and matches the description.",Positive,Negative
Not so superb but decent product quality,Positive,Negative
"The product seems good but I had an issue setting it up with eSIM so I had to return the product. Otherwise, overall appearance is good.",Positive,Negative
"293 Cycles on the battery Isn’t terrible , but you should have a good idea how used these phones are.",Positive,Negative
Looks like new! My brother loves his new phone. Price is great too.,Positive,Positive
This was a brand new iPhone with 0 cycles on the battery and 100% health. So impressed and happy about this. Thanks!!!,Positive,Positive
"It came so so early then originally expected. Didn’t come with a single scratch on it. But it did come with the wrong cord, luckily I already had a charge but that would be the only problem I experienced. Otherwise no other complaints.",Positive,Negative
The phone seems good but delivery did not give it to me in my place,Positive,Negative
"I received the phone in good condition, battery 100%, it was only used once, new not reconditioned, but the only bad thing is that it has a scratch on the screen a little big it is little noticeable but if it is there, it is the only bad thing I saw otherwise everything is 10/10",Positive,Positive
"After I brought the 15 Pro, 512GB, White Titanium for $1030, the price promptly dropped $65. The battery health was 92, in newer refurbished phones you can't expect a new battery. It has no SIM card tray, so don't erase your old phone until you have done the over-the-air phone number/service transfer. No scratches. It only comes with a UBC to UBC cable. The action button works well to make it an instamatic camera. It does get warm after use.",Positive,Positive
"The phone came in good condition, with a 100% battery but it had some scratches, they don't affect anything. But aesthetically it didn't look good",Positive,Negative
"I’m having a few issues with performance in regards to transfers of apps and the charging function. This is an amazing phone, and I’m expecting to be able to use it proficiently in the future. I believe it is durable and tough.",Positive,Positive
My phone has 100% battery health and visually it’s perfect except for a very very tiny scratch on the left side of the screen that is totally impossible to see unless you hold it up to the light at a very specific angle. The only reason I’m not giving it a 5 out of 5 stars is because I think the battery on the iPhone 15 pro just doesn’t last long enough but if you want to get a new phone with a couple hundred bucks off or so my refurbished one was basically as good as new! I definitely don’t regret it.,Positive,Positive
"The iPhone itself seems new, there were no scratches or blemishes as far as I saw. The battery health was 100% so that’s good. Transferring the data and eSIM was simple and I had no issues with that. It also arrived earlier than expected so that’s a plus but now I have to wait for the screen protector and a case to arrive. My only issue is that it could’ve been packaged better. The protective stickers looked like they were just slapped on in a rush and when I took it off there was glue left on the back cameras which I had to spend time cleaning. There’s still some residue left. The second pic shows what the iPhone came in. So far so good overall. Will wait and see if any issues pop up in terms of functionality.",Positive,Positive
"The phone meets all of my expectations. I was expecting the charging cable to be USB to USB-c instead of USB-c to USB-c, so I still had to purchase the former charging cable. That is my only disappointment. Overall a great purchase.",Positive,Positive
Came scratched a bit but it all seems to work just fine.,Positive,Positive
"Absolutely love my new Apple iPhone 15 Pro! The phone itself is fantastic. However, I encountered some delivery issues, and the seller could've been more helpful in resolving them. Additionally, I was disappointed to receive the phone in a non-original box and with a subpar cable included. Despite these setbacks, the phone itself is amazing.",Positive,Positive
The phone works ok,Positive,Positive
"he phone itself is nice. It didn’t come in the original apple box or with the original apple charger, but to be completely honest I did not care about that. I was just looking forward to the phone itself. Not even one or two hours of having it, it already began malfunctioning. I had immediately gone to my mobile carrier to get it activated, and it started turning off and on on its own, same as the video provided. For majority of the first day, I couldn’t even access it or even get to the lock screen. It would load up the logo as if it’s turning on, and then turn off immediately, and do it again for the rest of the day. At the end of the night, I was able to get it to load up to the lock screen. At this point, I just wanted to return it but at least erase all the information I had transferred in the very beginning. After a couple of days finding a way to fully erase, I was able to do so successfully. Today, I just returned it. I got the phone October 23, and it is October 26. Mind you, I had requested the return the day of the delivery, I just needed to find a way to make sure NONE of my information was in the phone when returning it. The picture of it in the box is most recent of when I was able to repackage it to return it.
Overall, disappointed in this order. I was excited, expecting a fine, normal functioning phone as everyone has been only mentioning good about it. I do not recommend. I’ll definitely just stick to buying original phones in store. If you need a new phone, just spend the extra few hundred dollars to buy a brand new one than to deal with one that may malfunction like this. Better safe than sorry.",Negative,Negative
"I have ordered 2 phones now from Amazon with the same thing, it claims to be boost locked and then when i check the imei it shows it is not compatible with boost. So I no longer have a working phone number because I didn't check first, assuming the description was accurate and tried to put service on a phone not compatible. So when I try to make a return it texts my phone number regardless of if I verify my account through email and won't let me continue without it. Horrible experience I'm now down $1200 for a month and I will just have to pay full price for my phone via my carrier.",Negative,Negative
"If you’re considering to buy this phone DONT. I got it a few months ago and for the first few days it was great until the charger port stopped working. The only way I can get it to charge is to blow in the charger port and most of the time it doesn’t work. When it does charge, it charges for a little bit then stops charging. I am very disappointed about this. This phone was supposed to last me 2 years and it didn’t even last me a month. I’m still using it btw because I can’t afford a new phone at the moment but plz for your own sake DONT buy this phone.",Negative,Negative
"I tried all avenues to get the phone to work. I tried different cables different computers. I tried to set up with out transferring data. After that the phone would function fine but, now I would have to recreate the entire data base I had spent years developing. It tried to upgrade to ios18.1. The phone would hang up and not complete the task. When I tried to transfer data from my old phone, it would get to the point of transferring data and hang up. I’ m sorry I had to returns the item. One other problem is the charging cable required me to purchase an adapter from male type c to male types to fit my computer for ITunes. I tried a friends iPhone 15 with his cable and it worked fine.",Negative,Negative
Phone worked for 30 minutes before going to SOS mode because it is on the unpaid list. Whoever owned the phone before me did not pay it off before trading it in and the seller never checked for this. Wasted my time going to Verizon and now UPS to return the phone and without a phone until the other one arrives.,Negative,Negative
"The phone worked for about a month before it got stuck in a boot loop. I took it in to my local Apple Store to get it looked at, and they found that in the refurbishing job, a key component that helps protect the device from atmospheric water damage was not reinstalled during the refurbishment process. Long story short, my issues were due to water damage from humidity, and the poor refurbishment voided Apple’s limited warranty. So I ended up with an expensive paperweight and am now investing in yet another phone. Be cautious of buying refurbished products.",Negative,Negative
"I received a “renewed” phone and when I opened it up there were still dozens of scratches on the screen. When I asked to return, the seller tried to only giving me a partial refund which is against Amazon policy. Don’t waste your time and find a different seller.",Negative,Negative
"This is a huge scam. Don’t believe what they say. I bought an iPhone 15 worked for a week. I took it to T-Mobile and after three days, they told me the phone was never paid off so the phone will never work. I have lost so much money from my business because of them.",Negative,Negative
"I was so excited to get this phone because the reviews seemed pretty good, I started setting up my phone and part of the set up process was updating the phone, so I updated it, and after the update the phone wouldn’t even turn on. I finally got it to turn on but then it wouldn’t go passed the Lock Screen. Not happy at all. Still haven’t received a refund",Negative,Negative
"I bought a “Refurbished” MacBook last year, after two months it died had to jump through some hoops just to get my refund. Just bought a “Refurbished” IPhone 15 worked great for two hours and then would not wake up. Had to keep plugging and unplugging the phone just to get it to wake up so I could erase the information, and send it back. Sent the phone back the June 14th UPS tracking shows that was received the 20th . And it is now the 26th have not heard anything back from the seller, about my refund. The sellers are out of New York and New Jersey just saying.",Negative,Negative
Phone seemed perfect until I had to make a phone call and I didn’t have my AirPods in. Then I realized the audio is so faint I can’t hear anything people were saying when they called. The speakerphone only worked for a moment and then the speaker started sounding unbearably scratchy. Had to return.,Negative,Negative
"The advertised product was clearly labeled ""unlocked"" TMobile iPhone when it was actually ""locked"" by Boost Mobile, so it was useless for my needs. I ended up with no telephone for days even during potential emergencies (in fact at the moment of this writing, a very strong hurricane is looming!). Imagine yourself.",Negative,Negative
The phone worked fine for a while until it went into SOS mode. TMo said the IMEI was blocked and nothing they could do. Waiting for seller to fix this!,Negative,Negative
"The phone came with a regular charger. It is not apple as I was expecting!!! When I plugged it in to charge the phone, it was not working. I am requesting a new apple charger as this phone is premium quality and should come with an apple charger. I don't know how I will charge my phone without a charger!!! I need to talk to the seller...",Negative,Negative
"THE PRODUCT WAS FAULTY AND THE SELLER'S RESPONSE WAS NIL, THE TRUTH WAS MY WORST PURCHASE",Negative,Negative
"Mine had a software glitch where the phone screen wouldn’t turn on if the phone was charging and in DND mode. Even when you unplug it, the screen wouldn’t turn on and would stay black. It took 10-30 mins for it to decide to turn back on. Pressing buttons does nothing because the phone thinks its display is on, and I’m left with an album full of screen shots of my Lock Screen from my trying to turn it on. This should not be happening in a brand new phone, I am so aggravated.",Negative,Negative
SOLD AS REFURBISHED/RENEWED BUT HAD SERVICE SHUT OFF BECAUSE IT HAD A PAYMENT PLAN OUTSTANDING STARTING FROM THE DAY WE PURCHASED. Selling stolen phones.,Negative,Negative
"I couldn’t even use the phone, had to send it back because the imei is still activated to another account through spectrum. The phone I had was not fully unlocked",Negative,Negative
"Battery at 100%. 5 battery cycles. Small scratches is what kept it from being excellent condition, would recommend.",Negative,Positive
"So I purchased this phone in May it was working good. I can make calls and receive messages and now in June I couldn’t make phone calls. I went to my carrier, and I was told that the phone was placed on the black market and was placed on a loss and damage mode which made me not able to make phone calls or receive text. so I returned the phone back never will. I shop from them again.",Negative,Negative
"I guess it would have been a great beautiful pink phone for my HARDWORKING 17 yr old daughter, but i was robbed of 700 bucks unfortunately.",Negative,Negative
It's only checked out not refurbished also didn't come with a charger even!,Negative,Negative
I bought a iPhone 15 ( exelent) But it had several scratches on screen and around.I returned it,Negative,Positive
This phone installment wasn’t paid off. I only used it for a week before I had to send it back. Whoever sold it hasn’t paid it off and it won’t work under any phone plan. It is a perfectly good phone but useless if you can’t talk or text.,Negative,Negative
"The phone itself is fine but when I tried to log into my Snapchat the device was banned completely, due to that fact I would not be able to log into that from my new phone again. The sound also sounded muffled as if there was water in it the whole time. For $530 it would be fine but definitely not worth it in my opinion.",Negative,Negative
Tried to activate device only to find out device is black listed. Device was in great shape looks brand new but is no good cause we cant use. Update: seller tried to say i need to use imei 2 but I personally called T-Mobile and they confirmed it’s black listed due to previous own not paying it off,Negative,Negative
The phone was working perfectly for the last couple months then just today it has been stuck on SOS mode.,Negative,Negative
The phone was packed cheaply and came with a burnt port. You can’t charge for its life. To make matters worse the screen was cracked. For something that coast nearly $700 I would expect better quality. This thing got to go back to the seller. Packed shipped REFUND PLEASE !,Negative,Negative
"Phone never booted up.. Took it to the Apple Store, it’s still under warranty & they are going to apply nearly $600 of repairs to it to get it functioning properly. Will be picking it up in 6 days… Buy at your own risk..",Negative,Negative
I bought this phone bc I had previously bought some phones from Amazon and it was a good deal but once it came I tried to transfer the eSIM but it said my phone was locked so I am sitting here without service,Negative,Negative

"I purchased this phone and when I went to activate it, Verizon informed me that this phone was reported lost or stolen. I contacted the seller and Amazon and I returned the item and was given a refund.",Negative,Negative
I paid $100 less than the original price. I had to go through Amazon to save some money. The phone was described as Excellent condition. But no it wasn’t. The outside body looks great but the charging port was damaged to the point where you can only use the charger cable on one side. You can clearly see stain in it. They sent me a very cheap old fashioned charging cable with a usb charging box. Which you can get both for as low as $10. The package was also very cheap. Not satisfied!,Negative,Negative
Apple iPhone 15 didn't work and returned it to them right away.,Negative,Negative
Phone does not always ring for incoming calls. Camera does not work at times....must turn phone completely off and back on to get camera to function. Have had this phone gone over at ATT.

I received the phone quickly. It looked great. My carrier (Xfinity) would not accept the phone as a transfer from my iPhone 10X. The IMEI was bad. Said it may be stolen. I sent it back. Wasted hours working out the problem of why it would not work.,Negative,Negative
"High price for the condition of the item. Rayones x everywhere, if it's like that on the outside, what you see, I can't imagine what it's like on the inside.
",Negative,Negative
"Phone itself functioned great , but this was advertised as an unlocked TMobile phone. TMobile locked the phone 2 weeks after I received the phone. Upon contacting the carrier I was told the previous owner has locked it and reported it stolen. Will put at 2 stars as they are refunding",Negative,Negative
It’s the second day and the iphone gets hot front and back and I downloaded and transferred the data I needed. It concerns me!,Negative,Negative
"I would not complain if I bought one in good condition, but I paid for an I Phone in Excellent Condition.",Negative,Negative
"The product was great, and appears to be like brand new. The problem was with shipping. I broke my phone, so I selected next day air shipping. It was additional 30 dollars. The seller didn’t next day air the package and would not refund the additional 30 dollar charge.",Negative,Negative
"iPhone presented several scratches, more than expected for a renew. It was just ‘used’. Terms are different",Negative,Negative
Overall is good. But a tiny scratch on the screen. Not sure whether this worth $200 price down.,Negative,Positive
"i know what you’re thinking, read the reviews, take your chances, and hopefully it’ll work out. that’s what i did too. i saw the bad reviews and the good ones and took a chance. well i’m here to say DONT DO WHAT I DID. i got the phone and started setting it up. had issues with it from the beginning but just thought it was my internet. kept trying to set it up and kept getting to the same part—the software update. it wouldn’t update, just kept loading. i even left it for hours and it did nothing. but now my service was transferred so i had to go through a whole long process to get it transferred back to my old phone. all in all, a HORRIBLE experience with this “refurbished phone”. DONT DO IT. save your money, time, and mental wellness.",Negative,Negative
"Phone had several VERY deep scratches on front screen. Impossible to miss. Seems negligent or scammy. The shipping package isn't the MOST secure but I doubt it was damaged during transit. Either way, very disappointed.",Negative,Negative
"While reading through the reviews, I have read very good comments about battery health, frequetly being around 99%. However I received my iPhone 15 pro with 89% life battery condition and 391 battery cycles in it. When contacting the vendor customer support (BuySPRY) , they stated the phone is ""within the described battery parameters on the website"" which where nowhere to be found that specifcally mentions battery health.. They added I should refer to ""what is Amazon Renewed"" for more details. In the amazon renewed page nowhere is discribe what battery condition should I expect from a renewed phone (over 90%, i.e.).",Negative,Negative
"iPhone 15 Pro I purchased was tied to another AT&T payment plan and could not be authorized to use with my account. AT&T was unable to help, they basically brick these phones and said the only way around this issue was to have the original party who owned the phone pay off their balance. The seller offered no troubleshooting steps, just told me to return the phone. Problem is, the prices of these refurbished phones fluctuate for each device so I cannot purchase another phone at the same price - they would not even offer a direct replacement. They obviously do not spend any time checking or verifying these phones so there is no way I will be going through this hassle again, with most likely the exact same outcome.",Negative,Negative
"My package arrived on time, but the packaging of the phone could have been better. It was shipped in a paper envelope, and the cardboard box was much too large for the phone. The phone was in a bubble wrap sleeve, which thankfully protected it, but the packaging didn’t seem secure. Additionally, I received the wrong charging cable—a Lightning cable instead of the USB-C cable that was specified in the description. Upon setting up the iphone, I find that the phone is unable to support eSIM. Will be returning phone.",Negative,Negative
"My husband bought one a couple of days and it was excellent so I decided to buy one. I choose the excellent condition but it was delivery poorly, only encased in a box and in a bubble rap, The device was dirty with poor battery and when I choose to return it the price was changed so if I return it will also lost money. Never buy again",Negative,Negative
When I got the iPhone in the mail. It was damaged it looked like someone tried to take it apart and the screw was stripped out. Also the battery percentage was only 81. So I will not be using Amazon to get another phone ever agai,Negative,Negative
"After hours of working with Verizon to transfer to the new phone, we were told a previous owner had a tracking app on it that won't allow them to activate the new phone. They are refunding our money but it has wasted most of our day.",Negative,Negative
This is a SCAM — the seller refused to issue a refund claiming I had sent back the “wrong item” when I returned the phone because the screen was glitching. I absolutely sent back the iphone I received in the mail and followed all return instructions. Don’t buy this item.,Negative,Negative
"Bought an Iphone 15 Pro hoping to receive an excellent product, cause I never had problems before, buyinh cell phones on Amazon. However, the cell phone came with defects that did not allow me to use the microphone, answer calls or record videos. Despite having reported the problem and receiving a refund, this company, BIDALLIES, withheld a large sum of money from what I had paid and did not cover the cost of shipping the cell phone in the refund they gave me. In the end, it was a total waste of money.",Negative,Negative
"The seller failed quality control, the esim could not be activated, device was not cleared for use. Amazon wanted me to rewrite this review to be more polite. This is not a product review of Iphone 15 pro it is a review of the seller",Negative,Negative
"I bought the excellent Refurbished option, which is supposed to be the best and the screen is not original, the front camera has a problem that makes it difficult to focus too. Very bad experience. In that photo you can see that tempered glass doesn't look good because the screen has ripples when it's not original",Negative,Negative
"The original post (with pictures) was not posted due to some guidelines issue, but the screen is very scratched, which is unacceptable for something that is supposed to be in excellent conditions. One of the scratches is so deep and so long that it almost looks as of the screen was cracked",Negative,Negative
"I like this phone, but the scratches are disappointing and the battery life on the phone is awful. I’m practically tethered to a cable. I’ve lost 7% in less than an hour and this device has apparently only gone through 6 battery cycles. Really disappointed, this is not at all what I thought it was.",Negative,Negative
I received this phone with a dead pixel in the screen. I'm upset because its so much money to buy this phone and If I keep it I would have to pay out of pocket to fix the screen. They said they cant send me a new phone and to just order a new one.....Why would I order a new phone if you don't fix the phone you gave me. I'm upset because it was suppose to be a gift. BUYER BEWARE if the phone has something wrong with it don't try to get another one. Wouldn't recommend anyone to go with this company since they don't care about the product they give out. I wouldn't care about scratches on the phone itself but the screen is vital and wasn't expecting to maybe pay for a whole new screen.,Negative,Negative
Took the phone to T-Mobile to transfer my number from my other phone was told by T-Mobile this phone was reported as lost or stolen unusable phone. I can’t believe it’s being sold on Amazon.,Negative,Negative
When going through the process of setting up this phone with the help of my service provider I was told the phone I received was reported as stolen. The phone could not be fully set up as it was stolen! It was a total waste of time and money to purchase this phone. I DO NOT recommend purchasing this item as you could unknowingly receive a STOLEN phone and not be able to use it! Stay away!! I wish I could give this product a zero stars.,Negative,Negative
Phone looked good but it had a screen protector on it- we removed it to find a crack in the screen. Not what we expected.,Negative,Negative
Phone will not download any apps. Contacted apple on the problem. Says that it needs to be fixed. Your better off just buying new!,Negative,Negative
"the phone it self is good. the company that ebay uses who refurbish these phones to sell suck, the phone works but the refreshing company didn’t check to see if the charging systems and ports were operable prior to selling. so when they say it has been through rigorous testing and all that it’s all a lie. simply put",Negative,Negative
BUYER BEWARE. TOTALLY FRAGILE. POOR BATTERY LIFE,Negative,Negative
"After several hours spent transferring files and setting up the new (refurbished) phone, I finally tested the cameras. Then I discovered the hidden issue: the front camera did not work at all and the main camera had something that looked like a broken lens, which made half the pictures (those taken with a certain magnification) include a reddish broken jagged shape, cutting across the screen. Too bad this turned out to be a waste of time. For close to $1000 I cannot accept a broken product.",Negative,Negative
Locked and useless. Only option was to return and purchase from another seller,Negative,Negative
I have just received the phone and it is Locked! Need to return it - what a waste!,Negative,Negative

"These phones are reported stolen or are not paid off, you will not be able to unlock. The phone is useless. Please do not buy it is not worth your money you are better off buying an iPhone brand new or through your service provider. The worst service I have received in my whole life",Negative,Negative
was write with sim slot but it s only E sim and if you travel europe you need sim tray.I sent back,Negative,Negative
"If you can’t use your phone all day then it shouldn’t get anything more than a star. Read user complaints and skip this version… this has been going on for months and Apple has not provided a fix for it. I’m going back to my 12 PM. Full charge at 7 and I need a charger at 1 PM with normal use, mostly emails and Teams chats.",Negative,Negative

"Different Box, missing charger header, charger color is black, phone is white. So weird! Possibly it would be working fine, but I am not going to open it further. I was thinking it would be like one time open, but I found it different.",Negative,Negative
It is very old used phone and a charger line is also dirty. I used my phone over 2 year but mine looks better. I decided to return it right away.,Negative,Negative
Phone was stole had to return. They did refund money fast though... Just pain to set up then reset my old phone after new one wouldn't work.,Negative,Negative
Do not purchase from this reseller. My phone was stolen and could not be activated after extensive wasted time on phone with my carrier,Negative,Negative

Would've expected it to come with a sim card slot since in Canada they still come with Them. And also in the description it literally mentions there being a slot.,Negative,Negative
"I recently purchased an iPhone 15 Pro from this seller, and it was a complete disappointment. The device arrived with noticeable physical damage: there were dents along the sides and scratches on the back camera, which was unacceptable for what was supposed to be a brand-new phone. Additionally, the battery health was only at 93%, which is way below the standard for a new device. Clearly, this phone was either used or poorly refurbished, despite being sold as new. I expected far better quality for such a premium product. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this seller – I regret not paying closer attention to other reviews before purchasing.",Negative,Negative
The mobile has scratches on both sides and battery health 92%,Negative,Negative
"The phone looked new and started up fine. But during the initial startup process, it forces you to upgrade to the latest IOS, and while I tried multiple times, it would not complete the installation so I was not able to get the phone to work. It would say could not complete the install, and goes back to the welcome screen. So disappointing. The seller approved the return, I returned the phone per the instruction, but I have not been refunded the money yet.",Negative,Negative
"I didn’t expect the original box, and that’s okay with me, but what I did expect was a phone with 100% battery health. Mine had 97% battery health and 240 cycles. It also didn’t come with the original charger, or even a USB C type on both ends, also came with some few scratches on the camera. Other than that, the phone runs well, and you really feel the difference between 60hz and 120hz. Is it worth it? Still not sure about that since the few problem it came with.",Negative,Negative
